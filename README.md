# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### STEP 1:
import math module.
### Step 2:
assign tha values for x1,x2,y1,y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the distance between two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math
x1=10
x2=4
y1=6
y2=2
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}")
~~~ 


### OUTPUT:
